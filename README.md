# slip
Slip is a simple bash program that allows screenshotting with maim, and immediate uploading with imgur.

It uses dmenu as a front-end menu.

## install
Copy the slip file to a directory of your choice.   
Make it the file executable with `chmod +x ./slip` (where "./" is your install directory).


## usage
To launch slip, run `./slip` (where "./" is wherever slip is installed).    
Alternatively, don't make the file executable and run slip with `bash ./slip`.

## qualms
Screenshotting can also be done with ffmpeg, eliminating an (optional?) dependency.     
Most people prefer maim for screenshots which is why it has been left in.

If you would prefer to use ffmpeg for screenshotting also, please let me know.
