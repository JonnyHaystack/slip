# slip
Slip is a simple bash program that allows screenshotting with maim, and immediate uploading with imgur.

## install
Copy the slip file to a directory of your choice.   
Make it the file executable with `chmod +x ./slip` (where "./" is your install directory).


## usage
To launch slip, run `./slip` (where "./" is wherever slip is installed).    
Alternatively, don't make the file executable and run slip with `bash ./slip`.
